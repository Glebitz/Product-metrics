# Product-metrics
Analysis and calculation of product metrics of users. Raw data taken from AppMetrica.
Data's time interval is from 1st of January 2020 to 31st of March 2020. In this project I analysed users' behavior and efficiency of acquisition channels.
Data's description is inside the file.

What I found out:
  1. According to cohort analysis the biggest conversion to purchase belongs to cohort with the first app installation on the 1st of January (39.3%). I consider a user to be a converted one if he purchased something within 7 days after app installation.
  2. Most of the people came from Yandex marketing channels.
  3. However, the worst conversion to the first purchase belongs to Yandex marketing channels as well.
  4. Funnel. Most of the customers leave our app after they tap a basket, that is they have something in the basket but do not purchase anything.
  5. As for the median bill. An average customer from our referral program spent the most.
  6. VK owns the best ROMI metric.
